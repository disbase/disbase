# Trakmod
Trakmod (or Tm/Trak3) is a library for easily building advanced Discord bots in Python in a scalable fashion.

## Installation
Tm is currently not available on pypi due to it being in a temporal unstable 0.1.0 beta.
Once we stablize 0.1.0 to be happy to launch it to pypi, it will be brought there.

## Stability Warning
Tm's 0.*.\* versions are supposed to be for testing only, 
we don't intend for real production bots to use these versions because they 
could hold massive breaking changes and entail bad fortune in terms of bugs.

## GitHub
You can install tm using our github link & git.

For this install, you will need to have [git](https://git-scm.com) installed.

```sh
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/trakmod/trakmod.git
```
