# Disbase
Disbase is a library for easily building advanced Discord bots in Python in a scalable fashion.

## Installation
Disbase is currently not available on pypi due to it being in a temporal unstable 0.1.0 beta.
Once we stablize 0.1.0 to be happy to launch it to pypi, it will be brought there.

## Stability Warning
Disbase's 0.*.* versions are supposed to be for testing only, 
we don't intend for real production bots to use these versions because they 
could hold massive breaking changes and entail bad fortune in terms of bugs.

## GitHub
You can install disbase using our github link & git.

For this install, you will need to have [git](https://git-scm.com) installed.

```sh
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/disbase/disbase.git
```
